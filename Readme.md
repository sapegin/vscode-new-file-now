# New File Now ðŸ†•

Create new files and directories quickly using the command palette.

_Inspired by the awesome [AdvancedNewFile extension](https://github.com/SublimeText/AdvancedNewFile) for Sublime Text._

## How it works?

1. Press the hotkey: <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd> on Mac or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd> on Windows.

**To create a folder**, append `/` to the path. For example, `taco/cat/`:

## Motivation

There are plenty of similar extensions (like [this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=patbenatar.advanced-new-file) or [this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dkundel.vscode-new-file)) but they are either broken, or confusing. I wanted something thatâ€™s easy to use, efficient, simple, and has great UX. Also, they werenâ€™t updated in years and donâ€™t use new Visual Studio Codeâ€™s APIs.
